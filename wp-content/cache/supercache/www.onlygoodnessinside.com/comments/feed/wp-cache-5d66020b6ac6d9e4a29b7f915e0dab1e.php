		<description><![CDATA[I came home from travel today and found 2 Ultra Vanillas in my mailbox. My pits are happy once again! Thank you, Dina!!

FYI: I tried a new deodorant called Peiper Wai that was on Shark Tank. Your deodorant is much better.  Peiper Wai is a dry thick paste that is difficult to apply because its so dry, and must be applied with your finger. Also, their deodorant smells earthy, versus yours which has no aroma or can be vanilla. And lastly, their&#039;s is gray which leaves a gray film on my skin making my underarms look dirty, your does not. Also today I noticed I did sweat with Peiper Wai, however, my sweat has no smell yet my shirt is wet. With your deodorant, there is absolutely no sweat, no wetness on my shirts. Dina, you&#039;ve created Gold!!! I say you go on Shark Tank!

Thank you for your dedication!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been using the Only Goodness regular deordorant  for 5 years and very firmly stand by its amazing effectiveness for eliminating body order  for up to three days in one use of the product. One 3 oz. bottle lasts for over 6 months for me, this gives one an idea of how little of the product needs to be applied to be effective. It also makes me feel good about myself using a product that is both a medicine and food for my body!!! I very strongly recommend that you try this product!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to thank you for all you do.  You make some great deodorant and I am glad I found your company.  I had used another deodorant that you rub under your arm but it was more of a pain in that you had to mix it up before putting it on and I also had trouble with it but not with your formula. I also like that unlike natural stick deodorants It does not stick to my underarms and the next day almost impossible to wash off.  I always enjoy what you have and really see the difference with it.  You make the best deodorant that I have ever used and glad to keep ordering.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a massage therapist, I always recommend taking an epsom salt bath with essential oils after a treatment. I’ve used many different brands of bath salts over the last 3 decades, and this is my favorite. At first I thought the scent might be a little too floral or feminine for me, but there’s something about it that brings me back to my childhood, and now I love it. I have to agree with Jessica, that the more I use it, the more I like the scent! They have figured out a wonderful blend. I just placed my 2nd order for 2 jars! I’ve also been using the deodorant for a couple of years now, and it’s ridiculous how much better and long lasting it is compared to any other deodorant I’ve tried. And the customer service is exceptional for an online store. If there’s ever a problem with a shipment, the owner is on the phone that same day explaining the situation. I noticed that they’ve expanded their product line, and I’m confident that anything I buy will be excellent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My class had a substitute Pilates instructor who had us do a bend that messed my back up instantly. I was in pain for the rest of the day and couldn&#039;t stand up straight. I applied arnica gel a few times, did cold packs off and on, then decided to soak my back in a few heaping tablespoons of this spa kit - and the next day I had almost zero pain. I know the combination of products helped, especially this bath soak which did wonders. Thank you for this product!!! I also want to add that the scent smells pretty good but it&#039;s one that grows on you so every time I use it I think it smells more and more amazing. I will definitely repurchase.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First day of summer and boy is it hot!  I live in Texas and from now until October we can expect more of the same.  I have been using Only Goodness Inside deodorant for over a year and it REALLY WORKS!  I am very sensitive to harsh chemicals and I even make lovely skin care products from organic carrier oils and essential oils for myself and others.  I started making my own products for personal use about 10 years ago because the store bought stuff even from health food stores was giving causing unwanted reactions.  Unfortunately I was unable to come up with an effective formula to use as a deodorant.  I found OGI online and gave it a try.  It&#039;s very impressive!  It works better than anything else I&#039;ve tried and I don&#039;t have an allergic reaction.  I especially like the formulas using essential oils because they give a subtle scent and offer some of the health benefits of the oils.  I just can&#039;t say enough GOODNESS about this product.  Thank you for consciously creating something so wonderful.  I will be a long time fan!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using my goodness deodorant for two years, and it is the best deodorant out there. It is not only that it&#039;s working, but the great thing about it is that there is no Aluminum and even though you sweat there is no odor. Thank you for making this great deodorant, and keep on doing great job with your other products.]]></description>
